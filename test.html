		<h1>History</h1>
		<br><br>
		<p>
			The Flying Spaghetti Monster mythology, also known as the 
			<br>Pastafarianism religion, was created in January 2005 by the genius 
			<br>physicist Bobby Henderson in an attempt to reveal the truth about the
			<br>world to as many people as he could. Bobby Henderson founded the
			<br>Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster when he realized that major 
			<br>religions didn't accept Pastafarianism. As the word about the amazing 
			<br>flying spaghetti monster spread along the internet, more and more people 
			<br>could join the faith and see the truth about our planet and history. As of 
			<br>today, there are more than 15 million believers and the number just keeps 
			<br>increasing every day that passes.

		<b><h1>The Creation Myth</h1></b>
		<br><br>
		<p>
			In the beginning, there existed only a divine being of absolute spaghetti,
			<br>but it grew weary and resolved to bring forth the greatest masterpiece of
			<br>all time, the universe. In 10,000 years, the entity created each and every 
			<br>thing. With its meatball, it created the stars and with just a thought, it 
			<br>created time itself and the fourth dimension. During the creation journey
			<br>of the entity, it accidentally closed one of its eyes. In this moment, when 
			<br>the eye was closed, darkness was born. After the entity finished the universe,
			<br>it decided that it was too boring, so it decided to make the universe seem 
			<br>as much older than it is (this is where fossils came from).
			<br>The entity created the universe but found it boring, so it began searching 
			<br>for a new project. A flat minor planet was discovered by the entity, which 
			<br>was unlike other planets. Sculptures were created on the planet and holy 
			<br>spaghetti sauce(known today as our blood) was used to feed them. This 
			<br>led to the emergence of the first people, known as the pirates.

		<b><h1>Flying Spaghetti Monster</h1></b>
		<p>
			The flying spaghetti monster is the creator of the universe and the most 
			<br>powerful being to ever exist. Its holy spaghetti sauce is the origin of life 
			<br>itself, as with that sauce the flying spaghetti monster created the first 
			<br>humans. The spaghetti monster is not only all-powerful but also all-knowing,
			<br>but because it is drunk 99 percent of the time it doesn’t remember anything,
			<br>in fact, the flying spaghetti monster doesn’t even remember it is a god 
			<br>or that it created the universe. “The flying spaghetti monster” isn’t actually the 
			<br>real name of this powerful god, it is a name that was given it by the pirates 
			<br>because if someone would say the real name out loud, he would just 
			<br>disappear, and never be found again. 
			<br>I willtell you the real name of the spaghetti monster but remember that I 
			<br>warned you no matter what even if your life depends on it NEVER say this 
			<br>name out loud or you will suffer fate worse than even death itself, the 
			<br>name is “Bob”.
